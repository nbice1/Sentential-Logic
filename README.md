# Sentential-Logic
This program can both determine the truth-value of complex formulas and construct proofs. 

The program contains two primary functions: evaluator() and prover(). 

The evaluator() function allows the user to assign truth-values to atomic formulae and then determine the truth-value of a complex formula. The prover() function allows the user to construct proofs in a sound and complete natural deduction system.
